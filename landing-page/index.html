            <p>
              The internet and social networks such as Facebook allow news affecting a community to spread fast,
              through established news sources such as the New York Times, new digital news outlets such as Salon,
              by citizen-journalists unaffiliated with public or private institutions, and through personal testimony
              published in personal social media accounts.  In recent years checking the accuracy of news before false
              claims are spread has become very difficult due to the speed at which news can be shared, and the number
              of people it can be shared with.  Both documented and undocumented immigrants can be susceptible to false
              claims due to the lack of official news sources regarding federal enforcement of immigration, and due to
              the way information is distributed unevenly throughout the community.</p>

            <p> Immigrant News aims to offer a platform where immigrants can find, share and verify truthful
            information about immigration activity and related news around the country.  It aims to tackle
            the specific problem of verifying news and stopping rumors for a community that is always seeking
            reliable and up to date information in a time of political uncertainty. The application will allow users
            to log in and start interacting with the application by either verifying news or contributing with
            their own news.  Immigrant News will have a reliability level assigned to each user.
            When someone is registered for the first time, reliability is set to ‘low’ and as the user
            interacts with the app, by verifying news correctly and marking incorrect news as false,
            reliability level will change accordingly. If a news item has been marked as true by a
            certain amount of people, the news can be considered truthful.
            </p>

              We focused on two personas: Marta, an undocumented immigrant woman in her 40’s who sees

              a detention at work.</h5>

                        <p> Marta reads rumors on Facebook about possible detentions, and sees
                        pictures that depict arrests, but is unable to corroborate the rumors, and still gets
                        anxious about the news.  She hears about stories of arrests and detentions directly from
                        her co-workers, so she is able to corroborate those stories.  She logs in regularly into
                        Immigrant News to see if other people have written about the rumors she has heard, and to
                        contribute what she has heard.</p>
                        <p>She reads on Facebook that immigration authorities are actively
                          checking US visas and immigration documents of random travelers in the Los Angeles
                          International Airport, and she is worried because she is traveling there for a family
                          wedding in a month.  She logs into Immigrant News to see if other people have reported
                          this rumor and if anyone has approved the rumor.  She searches for incidents at LAX, and
                          finds out that the rumor of ICE being active in the airport has been debunked, and feels
                          more confident about her travels.

                        <p>Shreyas is not undocumented, but has family members or friends who are
                          undocumented.  He is in his mid-20’s, and works at a factory that creates electronic parts.
                          One of his friends, Arjun, was
                          detained after an immigration raid at his workplace, a factory in the suburbs of Chicago.
                          ICE (Immigration, Customs, and Enforcement) agents went to the factory looking for one
                          employee who did not show up to a court hearing, and in the process of looking for the
                          employee, asked other employees at the factory their immigration status.  Arjun was honest
                          and told ICE that he was undocumented, and they arrested him for further questioning.</p>
                        <p>Shreyas is concerned that Arjun will be deported, and that Arjun
                          will have to leave his wife and 3 year old child.  He also wants other people to know that
                          ICE is conducting raids that include non-targeted immigrants.  He logs onto Immigrant News
                          to report the incident, and sees that other users have added information about similar raids
                          in the Chicago area.  It appears to be a trend.  He contacts the local news about this issue,
                          and local reporters begin questioning factories and the ICE agency in the area. </p>

          <p style="font-color:black;">
            In addition to creating user personas, we conducted a focus group interview with three individuals,
            self-identified as immigrants, for the requirements gathering phase. Our interview
            included both structured and unstructured questions with the objective to get answers for specific doubts
            as well as to collect unsolicited and useful clues and advice.  During the focus group, we split the
            process into three parts by discussing the project abstract, the project proposal, and finally the
            personas that we developed for the project.  After discussing each part, we asked prepared questions, and
            asked impromptu questions.

          <h2>Design + Sketches</h2>
          <p>We scheduled in-person meetings to create our sketches. All team members were in attendance and active
            participants during the sketch process.  We went through a sketching and design process for 4 design
            challenges that we chose from our requirements.  We will highlight the design process for one of our
            challenges, and the details of the rest are available <a href="http://www.google.com" style="color:blue;">here</a>.</p>

            two points.</h3>
          <p style="font-size:16px;">The Process: For each iteration of our design challenge, we allotted ourselves 5 minutes to sketch
            as many ideas we had for the given challenge. After the 5 minutes, we presented our sketch ideas.
            Thereafter, we critiqued each other’s sketches and recorded the critiques which would help focus
            the design sketches for the next iteration. We followed this process for each iteration until we
            converged to one design sketch. The final sketch was typically drawn by one team member.

        <h3><strong>Selected Formative Evaluation Results</strong></h3>
        <h4>Task 1: On the Immigrant News site, search for immigration enforcement related incidents at LAX airport.
          Find whether there is a related story in the search results newsfeed.</h4>
        <p style="font-size:16px;">
          Two out of three users were not able to find the advanced search, so it needs to be more visible.
          One potential way to make it more visible is to add an “Advanced Search” blue hyperlink as most users
          are typically familiar with.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:16px;">
          One user expressed confusion about the percentages next to each story that represent how trustworthy
          each story is. One possible improvement is to change the percentage just to the a number of people who
          have validated and invalidated it. The assumption here is that with this improvement, the color coding
          of the stories will become clear.
